by the time you're viewing this its probably out of date info

hello internet  
welcome to fixing niche problems a small subset of people are facing  

```
mediaplayer_invidious_enable 1
mediaplayer_invidious_instance  "https://silverdimond.github.io/super-goggles"
```

if you dont like the instance this uses, fork it, change it, use your fork   
this breaks volume control  


for reference   
`/embed/videoID?autoplay=1&start=0&volume=1&subtitles=en`  
is what you should be expecting after the url you set in instance

this breaks synchronisation, volume, blah blah
isn't something better than nothing?
